-- Getting started with Redux

- install redux with npm: 'npm i redux -S'

- import 'createStore' from 'redux'

- create a reducer 'changeCategories': function that takes a 'state' and an 'action' properties
  -- action should always contain a property 'type'

- create a 'store' with 'createStore' by passing the reducer

- Log the store in your console and investigate the options: there are 3 functions that are interesting for us
 -- getState
 -- dispatch
 -- subscribe
